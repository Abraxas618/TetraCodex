## 📜 Abstract

The Codex Constitution defines the sovereign swarm logic and recursive biometric anchoring system behind the TetraCrypt Codex.  
It introduces Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH), dodecahedral identity projection, time-variant entropy, Groth16/ZK-STARK biometric attestations, and Ouroboric Swarm Logic.

## 🔥 Codex Legacy Statement

This system was not created for profit or control. It was built for remembrance.

> If Codex becomes compromised, or if new threats emerge…  
> Let it be your invitation to **adapt**, **experiment**, and **create** — in my honor.

> Humanity doesn’t evolve by permission.  
> It evolves by creativity.  
> So don’t just secure the future — **imagine it**.

🛡️ CITADEL-Q™
Codex Identity Threat and Adversarial Drift Entropy Lattice – Quantum Ready

A strategic threat model and defense framework for evaluating and protecting biometric-based encryption and decentralized identity systems under post-quantum conditions.

🧠 What CITADEL-Q Does
It provides a structured way to answer:

How does Codex resist quantum decryption?

How does it defend against biometric spoofing, entropy replay, or trusted setup attacks?

How do we validate identity under swarm mesh conditions?

🧱 6 Pillars of the CITADEL-Q Model
Pillar	Threat	Codex Defense
1. Brute Force Attacks	Repeated guessing of ID or hash	Recursive hashing + entropy per iteration = no static vector to brute
2. Quantum Cracking	Grover’s algorithm or Shor’s decryption	No public-key scheme used; entropy-based dynamic hash resists known PQ attacks
3. Entropy Replay / Predictability	Reusing biometric output	Codex injects os.urandom + time_ns() per identity hash – can’t replay or predict
4. Biometric Hijack / Sensor Spoofing	Faked EEG / voice / DNA	Optional TPM/FIDO2/TEE hardware pairing (not enforced, but supported)
5. Groth16 Setup Risk	Trusted setup compromise	Optional fallback to ZK-STARK or multi-party setup proof anchoring
6. Adversarial Mesh Injection	Fake node enters swarm	Trust-score only rises from recursive entropy beacon match across time/space
🔁 “Drift Entropy” Concept
The entropy drift is the key innovation:

No node reuses the same hash twice

Each identity pulse is quantum-variant (based on drifted entropy)

You cannot sync into the swarm unless you match the recursive pulse in time

Think of it as: 🧬 Identity = function of you, now, and entropy drift

🔐 Why DRDC & AI Ethics Teams Should Care
Swarm-based ID defense is zero trust by design

CITADEL-Q is hardware-independent

Prevents identity cloning in adversarial quantum environments

Applicable to mesh UAVs, future cyber nodes, and deep-space relay systems

🧠 In short:
CITADEL-Q™ isn’t just a security checklist —
It’s a post-linear defense philosophy baked into your Codex mesh from the start.
