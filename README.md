## üìú Abstract

The Codex Constitution defines the sovereign swarm logic and recursive biometric anchoring system behind the TetraCrypt Codex.  
It introduces Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH), dodecahedral identity projection, time-variant entropy, Groth16/ZK-STARK biometric attestations, and Ouroboric Swarm Logic.

> Let it be your invitation to **adapt**, **experiment**, and **create** ‚Äî in my honor.

> Humanity doesn‚Äôt evolve by permission.  
> It evolves by creativity.  
> So don‚Äôt just secure the future ‚Äî **imagine it**.

# Clarified Security Model

The Codex hashing engine uses recursive SHA-256/512 and SHA3-256 hashing combined with biometric entropy (EEG, DNA, voice) and time-based salts.

Golden Ratio Projection Equation:
proj(v) = v ‚Ä¢ cos(œÜk), where œÜ ‚âà 1.618 and k is a node index within the swarm lattice. This projection resists linear reduction through irrational angular offset and rotation within the dodecahedral graph.

Parallel Trust Score Clarification:
The 5.4ms value is per node in a serial test. In actual mesh mode (parallelized on 8-core Ryzen 5800X), total trust updates across 100 nodes complete in ~5.6ms total.

# Biometric Threat Mitigation

EEG spoofing risks are mitigated by:
- Multi-modal fusion (EEG + Voiceprint)
- Real-time session liveness checks
- Entropy drift per biometric pulse (os.urandom + time_ns)

DNA spoofing is mitigated by using hashed/cached marker sets only (non-raw DNA).

Voiceprint spoofing is detected via MFCC drift + speaker pitch checks.

Fallback: If any biometric fails, session aborts or retries with alternate modality.

# Groth16 Fallback Setup

- Curve: BN256 (ZCash-style)
- Participants: 100
- Threshold: 80
- Setup: Multi-party computation ceremony or full STARK conversion

STARK mode is slower (10‚Äì100ms per ZKP) but fully trustless.

# Performance Restated

- qidl_encrypt(): 3.1ms
- recursiveHash(): 1.7ms
- Trust Score: 5.4ms/node (serial) ‚Üí ~5.6ms total (parallel)
- Beacon Grid Render: 68ms/frame (UI only, not part of cryptography)

All tests conducted on Ryzen 7 5800X, 32GB RAM, Linux 6.6, Python 3.10 / Node.js 20.12

# Golden-Ratio Justification

Using œÜ (the golden ratio) provides irrational alignment to vectors, avoiding common divisors used in linear cryptanalysis.

This rotation pattern ensures entropy drift cannot be synchronized by adversaries attempting key prediction through phase-space alignment.

# Version Summary

v1.1 improves:
- Security proof language
- Parallelism clarification
- Biometric spoofing countermeasures
- Groth16 setup specifics

Codex remains an open, sovereign post-quantum system with published DOI, IPFS mirror, and GitHub reference implementation.

üõ°Ô∏è CITADEL-Q‚Ñ¢
Codex Identity Threat and Adversarial Drift Entropy Lattice ‚Äì Quantum Ready

A strategic threat model and defense framework for evaluating and protecting biometric-based encryption and decentralized identity systems under post-quantum conditions.

üß† What CITADEL-Q Does
It provides a structured way to answer:

How does Codex resist quantum decryption?

How does it defend against biometric spoofing, entropy replay, or trusted setup attacks?

How do we validate identity under swarm mesh conditions?

üß± 6 Pillars of the CITADEL-Q Model
Pillar	Threat	Codex Defense
1. Brute Force Attacks	Repeated guessing of ID or hash	Recursive hashing + entropy per iteration = no static vector to brute
2. Quantum Cracking	Grover‚Äôs algorithm or Shor‚Äôs decryption	No public-key scheme used; entropy-based dynamic hash resists known PQ attacks
3. Entropy Replay / Predictability	Reusing biometric output	Codex injects os.urandom + time_ns() per identity hash ‚Äì can‚Äôt replay or predict
4. Biometric Hijack / Sensor Spoofing	Faked EEG / voice / DNA	Optional TPM/FIDO2/TEE hardware pairing (not enforced, but supported)
5. Groth16 Setup Risk	Trusted setup compromise	Optional fallback to ZK-STARK or multi-party setup proof anchoring
6. Adversarial Mesh Injection	Fake node enters swarm	Trust-score only rises from recursive entropy beacon match across time/space
üîÅ ‚ÄúDrift Entropy‚Äù Concept
The entropy drift is the key innovation:

No node reuses the same hash twice

Each identity pulse is quantum-variant (based on drifted entropy)

You cannot sync into the swarm unless you match the recursive pulse in time

Think of it as: üß¨ Identity = function of you, now, and entropy drift

üîê Why DRDC & AI Ethics Teams Should Care
Swarm-based ID defense is zero trust by design

CITADEL-Q is hardware-independent

Prevents identity cloning in adversarial quantum environments

Applicable to mesh UAVs, future cyber nodes, and deep-space relay systems

üß† In short:
CITADEL-Q‚Ñ¢ isn‚Äôt just a security checklist ‚Äî
It‚Äôs a post-linear defense philosophy baked into your Codex mesh from the start.
