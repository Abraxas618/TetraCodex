# 🧬 An Introduction to TetraCodex

> **Codename:** TetraCodex  
> **Version:** v1.0  
> **Maintainer:** Michael Tass MacDonald (`Abraxas618`)  
> **Type:** Post-Quantum Cryptographic Sovereignty System  
> **Status:** Active Vault Instance | Swarm-Ready

---

## 🔍 Overview

**TetraCodex** is a sovereign cryptographic framework designed to resist classical and quantum decryption techniques using:

- Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH)
- Platonic-encoded Quantum Isoca-Dodecahedral Logic (QIDL)
- Swarm-based biometric liveness and trust networks

It integrates biometric entropy, geometric lattice design, and real-time zkSNARK validation in a unified post-quantum infrastructure.

## 🔐 Core Objectives

- 🧠 Protect identity via EEG, DNA, and voice-based biometric entropy
- 🔄 Generate zkSNARK-based proof-of-liveness (ZK_Liveness)
- 🛰 Anchor identities in a distributed, recursive trust mesh (SwarmQuorum)
- 🛠 Run on FPGA, browser (WASM), and sovereign embedded nodes

---

## 📦 Modules

Each documentation page in the sidebar corresponds to a Codex system module:

- `Biometric Trials`  
- `FPGA Benchmark`  
- `FPR/FNR Metrics`  
- `MPC Ceremony`  
- `ZK Trust Circuit`

## 🧾 Governance & Ethics

TetraCodex operates under a sovereign framework inspired by:

- Indigenous cryptographic self-determination
- Post-linear ethics of identity protection
- Transparency through reproducible builds + open zk logic

> All biometric data used is anonymized, hashed, and zero-knowledge verified.
> No raw input is ever published or transmitted.
